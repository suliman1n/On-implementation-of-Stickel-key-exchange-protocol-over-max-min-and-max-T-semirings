%FUZZYSYSTEM Define and solve fuzzy linear system of equations or
%inequalities.
%   OBJ = FUZZYSYSTEM() Create a an empty FUZZYSYSTEM object. 
%
%   OBJ = FUZZYSYSTEM(COMPOSITION) Created a FUZZYSYSTEM object and specify
%   its composition.
%   
%   OBJ = FUZZYSYSTEM(COMPOSITION, A) Created a FUZZYSYSTEM object, specify
%   its composition and a fuzzy matrix as a matrix of the coefficients.
%   
%   OBJ = FUZZYSYSTEM(COMPOSITION, A, B) Created a FUZZYSYSTEM object, specify
%   its composition, a fuzzy matrix as a matrix of the coefficients and the
%   right-hand side fuzzy vector of the system.
%   
%   OBJ = FUZZYSYSTEM(COMPOSITION, A, B, X) Created a FUZZYSYSTEM object, specify
%   its composition, a fuzzy matrix as a matrix of the coefficients, the
%   right-hand side fuzzy vector of the system and the vector with the
%   unknowns.
%   
%   OBJ = FUZZYSYSTEM(COMPOSITION, A, B, X, FULL) Created a FUZZYSYSTEM
%   object, specify its composition, a fuzzy matrix as a matrix of the
%   coefficients, the right-hand side fuzzy vector of the system, the
%   vector with the unknowns and whether full solution should be obtained
%   on solving the system. If TRUE, on solving the system, property X will
%   contain a structure all the solutions of the system. If FALSE, only
%   the greatest/lower (depends on the system's norm) solution will be
%   given. Default is FALSE.
%   
%   OBJ = FUZZYSYSTEM(COMPOSITION, A, B, X, FULL, INEQUALITIES) Created a
%   FUZZYSYSTEM object, specify its composition, a fuzzy matrix as a matrix
%   of the coefficients, the right-hand side fuzzy vector of the system, the
%   vector with the unknowns, whether full solution should be obtained
%   on solving the system and whether the system is with equations or with
%   inequalities. INEQUALITIES can hold one of -1, 0, +1. If -1 then the
%   system is A.X <= B, if +1 the system is A.X>=B, if 0 the system is
%   A.X=B. Deafault is 0.

%   Methods
%   -------
%   Type "methods fuzzySystem" to see a list of the methods. This class
%   extends class handle, so its methods will display as well. Specific
%   methods for this class are:
%   solve_direct, solve_inverse
%
%   For more information about a particular method, type
%   "help fuzzySystem/methodname" at the command line.
%
%   Example 1
%   ---------
%   Create random fuzzy system of '<=' inequalities with max-product
%   composition and solve its inverse problem, finding all its solutions:
%   
%   a = fuzzyMatrix(5); b = fuzzyMatrix(5,1);
%   s = fuzzySystem('maxprod', a, b, fuzzyArray(), true, -1);
